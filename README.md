This is a project intended to demonstrate a competent understadning of both
HTML and CSS. Ideally I will have a beautiful vapor-wave themed website with
all original art by myself. 

After having completed the project, I am proud with the outcome. I did not
entirely do the exact format shown, however, I think the creative
liberties I took add nicely to the entire aesthetic of the page. It 
ended up looking much more like a throwback Windows '98 page, which
I absolutely love. The only thing I have not done is creating the pallate
page, which I suppose I will do nect.
